Perfect 👍 — let’s make a developer-ready feature list for your AI Assignment Canvas (with Firebase Auth + Stripe).
I’ll break it down into Core Features, Student Side, Teacher Side, Admin Side, and Tech Integrations so your developer gets a clear scope.

You are acting as a technical architect. I am building an AI-powered assignment canvas platform. I’ve already written a feature list (see below).

👉 Your job:

Take the feature list.

Expand it into a developer-ready scope with:

Suggested MongoDB schema design (collections + fields + relationships).

Suggested API endpoints (REST/GraphQL, with request/response examples).

Suggested frontend components/pages (React/Next.js style).

Suggested workflow diagrams or step-by-step flows (e.g., Student submits assignment → AI → Save → Teacher Review).

Suggested integration points (Firebase, Stripe, AI API).

Make sure each feature is mapped to backend + frontend + DB responsibilities.

Include security considerations (role-based access, preventing cheating, safe AI usage).

Provide a phased implementation roadmap (MVP → Advanced features).
